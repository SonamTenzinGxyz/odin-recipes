    <p><strong>Makhani Recipe | Restaurant Style Dal Makhani</strong> Recipe with detailed photo and video recipe. A popular North Indian or Punjabi Cuisine creamy & rich dal recipe prepared with black urad dal and kidney beans. Unlike other lentil or dal recipes, this black-colored dal is known for its creamy, rich, and savory flavored texture. The texture of this makhani dal is achieved mainly by slow-cooking the lentils and kidney beans.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, the dal makhani recipe is prepared using a slow cooking method either using a clay pot or tandoor oven. As a matter of fact, the process begins with soaking urad dal and rajma overnight. Once it is soaked properly it is slowly cooked for hours so that it releases its butter which makes it a creamy and rich dal recipe. However, we do not have such luxury and resources and hence we always look for something economical and quicker option. Yet do not compromise on the authentic taste and texture of this recipe. One such method is using the pressure cooker which not only hastens the cooking process but also makes it creamy and rich. Having said that, slow cooking in a tandoor oven cannot be easily mimicked with just a pressure cooker. However, if you crave something like dhaba style or restaurant-style dal makhani, you should try this cooker recipe. You can easily serve it with a choice of rice or roti recipes. Let me know if this recipe matches your favorite restaurant`s taste.</p>
