    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Every culture around the globe has a dumpling. From raviolis to pierogis, empanadas to samosas, the idea of wrapping something carby around something intensely flavored is no new concept. Cultures make dumplings of every size and shape, from tiny fingertip-sized manti in Turkey where you might get as many as six or eight in one spoonful, to giant Chinese soup dumplings, where a single one can fill a bowl. Asian cultures have given the world an entire alphabet of dumplings from Japanese akashiyaki to Nepalese gong'a momo, Korean pyesonu to Chinese zhaliang, and literally every other letter in between. Which means, no matter what your background, there is probably at least one or two traditional dumplings to explore. So, what is stopping you?</p>
    <p>Generally, unless you have a strong dumpling-making history, most of us shy away from labor-intensive, fussy foods. Everyone is living busy lives, and dumplings go down fast, so the idea of having to batch up dozens of small pouches for family dinner between work and home life seems incomprehensible to most of us. But we have forgotten the fundamental rule of all dumplings: They are not meant to be made alone.</p>
