    <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>the fried rice recipe is generally made with an egg omelette and choice meat added to it with finely chopped veggies. It makes it a complete meal and balanced diet meal in south-east Asian cuisine. Having said that, the same recipe has been improvised in India to meet the local dietary requirements, especially by skipping egg yolk and meat protein. It has become a must-dish in almost all fine dining restaurants and street vendors’ menus and can be seen served with Indian curry side dishes. I personally like the combination of moong dal fry with vegetable fried rice, and I make it regularly for my lunch or dinner.</p>
     <p>Furthermore, I would like to add some tips, suggestions and recommendations for a perfect veg fried rice recipe. Firstly, I always like to prepare this recipe with long-grain basmati rice for a non-sticky result. You can also make it with sona masuri, but use it only if you do not have a long-grain option. Secondly, traditional Chinese fried rice does not use any other seasoning, other than soy sauce and vinegar. You can even skip the addition of salt (can control with soy sauce) and pepper and add chilli sauce to make things spicy. Lastly, stir-fry the finely chopped vegetables on a high flame before adding cooked rice. At the same time, do not overcook the veggies it has to be crunchy and have to hold their shape.</p>
